# Sudoku Solver

Solving a sudoku puzzle with ruby.

## Background

This short project aims to solve a sudoku puzzle using ruby.

It does so with a recurrsive solver - iterating through each box, it inserts a non-invalid number, until it has finished.

An alternative approch would be only inserting a number if it definitely belongs there, ie. can't go anywhere else.

## Setup

+ Execute run.rb
+ Follwing instructions, inputting puzzle boxes

## ToDo

+ Alert user if input is impossible

## Acknowledgments

+ Professor Thorsten Altenkirch - Computerphile [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM)
